 Task1 : Chat with PDF Using RAG Pipeline 
 
The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to interact with semi-structured data in multiple PDF files.
The system should extract, chunk, embed, and store the data for e icient retrieval. It will answer user queries and perform  comparisons accurately, leveraging the selected LLM model for generating responses. 

The libraries used are:

PyMuPDF: For PDF manipulation (extraction of text).
OpenAI: For leveraging the LLM (if applicable based on your access).
sentence-transformers: For creating embeddings.
faiss-cpu: For efficient similarity search of vector embeddings.

The main tasks to perform are:
1. Data Ingestion
2. Query Handling
3. Comparison Queries
4. Response Generation

To develop an application that performs activities like chat with PDF Using RAG Pipeline, we used to develop a user friendly code in python.
